To play the game you can go to this repo's Github Pages site at <https://justusaac.github.io/custom-2048/> or download the `index.html` file and open it in your browser.  

This is a game that expands upon the 2048 game where numbered tiles are shifted around a 4x4 grid and get combined when moved into a tile with the same number.  
You can create new shapes for the game board by selecting spots on the grid to be used either as open spaces for the tiles to move to or as walls.  
You can also configure which tiles will spawn after each move, they don't necessarily need to have numbers accessible in the original game.  
This game also features an AI player, it seems to be about as good as I am.  
There's also an option to spawn the tiles adversarially in the way that is "worst" for the player instead of at random, this works pretty much the same way as the AI player does.
